In Esperanto, all words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: rad'''i'''o, tele'''vi'''do. In Ido all polysyllables are stressed on the second-to-last syllable except for verb [[infinitive]]s, which are stressed on the last syllable—'''sko'''lo, ka'''fe'''o and '''ler'''nas for "school", "coffee" and the present tense of "to learn", but i'''rar''', sa'''var''' and drin'''kar''' for "to go", "to know" and "to drink". If an '''i''' or '''u''' precedes another vowel, the pair is considered part of the same syllable when applying the accent rule—thus '''ra'''dio, fa'''mi'''lio and '''ma'''nuo for "radio", "family" and "hand", unless the two vowels are the only ones in the word, in which case the "i" or "u" is stressed: '''di'''o, '''fru'''a for "day" and "early".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.literaturo.ido.li/kgd.pdf|title=Acento tonika|trans-title=Tonic accent|last=De Beaufront|first=L|work=Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di Ido|pages=11–12|year=2004|accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>== Orthography ==Esperanto eliminates the letters ‹[[q]]›, ‹[[w]]›, ‹[[x]]›, and ‹[[y]]› from the 26-letter [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] and adds the new letters ‹[[ĉ]]›, ‹[[ĝ]]›, ‹[[ĥ]]›, ‹[[ĵ]]›, ‹[[ŝ]]› and ‹[[ŭ]]›. Ido uses the 26-letter alphabet without changes, substituting [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for Esperanto's [[diacritic]]s. While words in both Ido and Esperanto are spelled exactly as they are pronounced, the presence of digraphs means that Ido does not have the one-to-one correspondence between letters and [[phoneme|sounds]] that Esperanto has. However, Ido's digraphs are more recognizable to speakers of Romance languages and its avoidance of diacritics guarantees that any computer system that supports English could easily be used for Ido.The ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' does allow the use of the digraphs ‹ch›, ‹gh›, ‹hh›, ‹jh›, ‹sh› and the single letter ‹u› instead of the ordinary diacritical letters of Esperanto when those are unavailable. With the advent of computers, another system of surrogate Esperanto writing using ‹cx›, ‹gx›, ‹hx›, ‹jx›, ‹sx› and ‹ux› was introduced. It however remains unofficial.In general, the letter ''ĥ (the guttural sound)'' in Esperanto becomes ''h'' or ''k'' in Ido. The letters ''ĝ'' and ''ĵ'' are merged into ''j'' (which has the sound of "s" in "leisure") while ''ĉ'', ''ŝ'', ''ŭ'', ''ks''/''kz'', and ''kv'' respectively become ''ch'', ''sh'', ''w'', ''x'', and ''qu''.== Morphology ==Both in Ido and in Esperanto, each word is built from a root word. A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain [[affix]]es between the root and the grammatical ending.Some of the grammatical endings of the two languages are defined as follows:{| class="wikitable";
! Grammatical form	! Ido	! colspan=2 | English	! colspan=2 | Esperanto;
! [[Noun|Singular noun]]| ''' -o''' (libro)	| colspan=2 | book	| colspan=2 | '''-o''' (libro);

! [[Imperative mood|Imperative]]| '''-ez''' (irez)	| colspan=2 | go!	| colspan=2 | '''-u''' (iru);
! [[Conditional mood|Conditional]]| '''-us''' (irus)	| colspan=2 | would go	| colspan=2 | '''-us''' (irus)|}Most of these endings are the same as in Esperanto except for ''-i'', ''-ir'', ''-ar'', ''-or'' and ''-ez''. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an ''agglutinative'' ending ''-j'' (so plural nouns end in ''-oj''), uses ''-i'' for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses ''-u'' for the imperative. Verbs in both Esperanto and Ido do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -'''as''', -'''is''', and -'''os''' endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.Both languages have the same grammatical rules concerning nouns (ending with -o), adjectives (ending with -a) and many other aspects. (However, the relationship between nouns, verbs and adjectives underwent a number of changes with Ido, based on the principle of '''reversibility'''.) In both languages one can see a direct relationship between the words ''multa'' "many" and ''multo'' "a multitude" by simply replacing the adjectival ''-a'' with a nominal ''-o'', or the other way around.Some minor differences include the loss of [[adjective|adjectival agreement]], and the change of the plural from an [[agglutinative]] ''-j'' tacked onto the end to a [[synthetic language|synthetic]] replacement of the terminal ''-o'' with an ''-i''. Hence, Esperanto ''belaj hundoj'' ("beautiful dogs") becomes Ido ''bela hundi''. Ido also does away with the direct object ending ''-n'' in sentences where the subject precedes the object, so Esperanto ''mi amas la belajn hundojn'' ("I love the beautiful dogs") would in Ido become ''me amas la bela hundi''.Greater differences arise, however, with the derivations of many words. For example, in Esperanto, the noun ''krono'' means "a crown", and by replacing the nominal ''o'' with a verbal ''i'' one derives the verb ''kroni'' "to crown". However, if one were to begin with the verb ''kroni'', "to crown", and replace the verbal ''i'' with a nominal ''o'' to create a noun, the resulting meaning would not be "a coronation", but rather the original "crown". This is because the root ''kron-'' is inherently a noun: With the nominal ending ''-o'' the word simply means the thing itself, whereas with the verbal ''-i'' it means an action performed with the thing. To get the name for the performance of the action, it is necessary to use the suffix ''-ado'', which retains the verbal idea. Thus it is necessary to know which part of speech each Esperanto root belongs to.Ido introduced a number of suffixes in an attempt to clarify the morphology of a given word, so that the part of speech of the root would not need to be memorized. In the case of the word ''krono'' "a crown", the suffix ''-izar'' "to cover with" is added to create the verb ''kronizar'' "to crown". From this verb it is possible to remove the verbal ''-ar'' and replace it with a nominal ''-o'', creating the word ''kronizo'' "a coronation". By not allowing a noun to be used directly as a verb, as in Esperanto, Ido verbal roots can be recognized without the need to memorize them.Ido corresponds more overtly to the expectations of the Romance languages, whereas Esperanto is more heavily influenced by Slavic semantics and phonology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}== Syntax ==Ido word order is generally the same as Esperanto ([[subject–verb–object]]). The sentence ''Mi havas la blua libro'' is the same as the Esperanto ''Mi havas la bluan libron'' ("I have the blue book"), both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:* In both Esperanto and Ido, adjectives can precede the noun as in English, or follow the noun as in Spanish. Thus, ''Mi havas la libro blua'' means the same thing.* Ido has the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n'', but unlike Esperanto, this suffix is only required when the object of the sentence is not clear, for example, when the subject-verb-object word order is not followed. Thus, ''La blua libron me havas'' also means the same thing.Unlike Esperanto, Ido does not impose rules of grammatical [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between grammatical categories within a sentence. Adjectives don't have to be pluralized: in Ido ''the large books'' would be ''la granda libri'' as opposed to ''la grandaj libroj'' in Esperanto.== Vocabulary ==Although Esperanto and Ido share a large amount of vocabulary, there are differences. The creators of Ido felt that much of Esperanto was either not internationally recognizable, or unnecessarily deformed, and aimed to fix these with more "international" or "corrected" roots. This can sometimes be at the expense of Esperanto's simpler word building process.Ido, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male gender in roots such as for family. For example, Ido does not derive the word for ''waitress'' by adding a feminine suffix to ''waiter'', as Esperanto does to derive it from neutral to only feminine. Instead, Ido words are defined as gender neutral, and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine words from the root: ''servisto'' for a waiter of any gender, ''servistulo'' for a male waiter, and ''servistino'' for a waitress. There are only two exceptions to this rule:<ref name="Chandler">{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=James|date=6 November 1997|title=Changes in Ido since 1922|url=http://interlanguages.net/changes.html|accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref> First, ''patro'' for ''father'', ''matro'' for ''mother'', and ''genitoro'' for ''parent'', and second, ''viro'' for ''man'', ''muliero'' for ''woman'', and ''adulto'' for ''adult''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://idomondo.org/skolo.1.6.pdf|title=Ido For All|last=ApGawain|first=Niklas|author2=P.D.

English has also had large influences from French and Latin. In comparison, Esperanto is somewhat more influenced by German vocabulary and Slavic semantics (as in the case of prefix mal-) and has more priority over word compounding by affixes.]=== Unasenceso ===Another principle of Ido is ''Unasenceso'' or "one sensedness." This means each Ido root is supposed to correspond to only one meaning. Ido proponents feel that this allows for more precise expression than in Esperanto.=== Affixes ===Ido claims the prefix ''mal-'' (creating a word with the exact opposite meaning) in Esperanto to be overused as a prefix, and also to be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages, and introduces ''des-'' as an alternative in such cases. Ido also uses a series of opposite words in lieu of a prefix. For example, instead of ''malbona'' ("bad", the opposite of ''bona'', "good"), Ido uses ''mala'', or instead of ''mallonga'' ("short", the opposite of ''longa'', "long"), ''kurta''. Listening comprehension was also given as a reason: the primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the [[Latin]]-based ''sinistra'' for "left" instead of ''maldextra'' (''mal-'' plus the word ''dextra'', or ''dekstra'' for "right") is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. Esperanto has developed alternate forms for many of these words (such as ''liva'' for ''maldekstra''), but most of these are rarely used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/vortfarado/afiksoj/prefiksoj/mal.html |title=MAL |date=9 March 2010 |language=Esperanto |accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref>An extreme example of overuse of the ''mal-'' suffix.{| class="wikitable"!Esperanto|La malbela maljunulino mallaŭte malfermis la pordon al sia kelo kaj malrapide malsupreniris la ŝtuparon.;
!Ido|La leda oldino silence apertis la pordo a sua kelero e lente decensis l'eskalero.;
!English|The ugly old woman quietly opened the door to her basement and slowly descended the stairs.|}Most Esperanto words are gender-neutral ("table", "grass", etc.). However, Esperanto assumes the male [[grammatical gender|gender]] by default in other words, mainly words dealing with [[Kinship terminology|familial relationships]] and some animals. These words can be made female with the use of the feminine suffix. In Ido there is no default gender for normal root words, and one simply adds the corresponding masculine or feminine suffix only when desired. For example, ''frato'' means "brother" in Esperanto, but "sibling" in Ido. Ido uses the suffixes ''-ino'' ("female", used as in Esperanto) and ''-ulo'' ("male", not to be confused with the same Esperanto suffix which means "person"). Thus "sister" is ''fratino'' (the same as Esperanto), but brother is ''fratulo''. "Sibling" and other gender neutral forms are especially difficult in Esperanto since Esperanto simply does not have a word for such gender neutral forms. Esperanto does, however, have an epicene prefix that indicates "both sexes together": ''ge-''. ''Patro'' means "father" and ''patrino'' "mother"; ''gepatroj'' means "parents". In standard usage ''gepatro'' cannot be used in the singular to indicate a parent of unknown gender; one would say instead ''unu el la gepatroj'', "one (out) of the parents".There is a nonstandard suffix in Esperanto that means "male": ''-iĉo'' (see [[Gender reform in Esperanto]]).  There is also an existing prefix, ''vir-'', with the same meaning, used for animals.A few exceptions exist in Ido's gender system as described above, which avoid its suffix system, for which it was decided that the feminine words were so much more recognizable to its source languages: ''viro'' ("man"), ''muliero'' ("woman"), ''patro'' ("father"), and ''matro'' ("mother"). Compare these with Esperanto ''viro'', ''virino'', ''patro'', and ''patrino'', respectively. Ido also has several other neutral-gender words, such as ''genitoro'' for "parent". ''Gepatri'' in Ido means the same as Esperanto ''gepatroj'' (i.e. "parents" of both genders); ''genitori'' means "parents" in the English sense, not making any implication of gender whatsoever.Other words, such as ''amiko'' ("friend"), are neutral in Esperanto as well as Ido.=== Correlatives ===Esperanto adopts a regular scheme of [[correlative]]s organized as a table. Ido combines words together and changing word endings with some irregularities to show distinction, which is not as regular as that of Esperanto but is better distinctable by ear.{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"! colspan="3" rowspan="3" |! colspan="2" |Relative andinterrogative! colspan="2" |Demonstrative! colspan="2" |Indeterminate!MostIndeterminate! colspan="2" |Negative! colspan="2" |Collective;

Ten studied the Esperanto on January 4 and the Ido on January 5. Ten studied the Ido on January 4 and the Esperanto on January 5.Following the ninety minutes of study there was a multiple choice test. On January 6 there was a test in which the subjects were required to write the Esperanto and the Ido equivalents of the English words (''all'', ''always'', ''each'', ''every'', ''everything'', ''for no reason'', ''how'', etc.) Both multiple choice test and recall test for both Esperanto and Ido were repeated on January 23 and April 23. From January 9 to January 23 the subjects had twenty hours of teaching and study of Esperanto, so that only the tests before January 9 are valid for the comparison of the two languages. In these early tests the median number of the 45 multiple choices was 44 for Esperanto and 43 for Ido: the median number recalled correctly from the 45 English words was 32 for Esperanto and 15½ for Ido. The corresponding averages were 28 and 20. The Esperanto system was easier to learn for this group. But the experiment should be repeated with other groups.|International Auxiliary Language Association, 1933<ref name="Language Learning" />}}=== Pronouns ===The [[pronoun]]s of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in ''i''. Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns ''mi'' and ''ni'' may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has ''me'' and ''ni'' instead. Ido also distinguishes between [[T-V distinction|intimate (''tu'') and formal (''vu'')]] second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (''vi'') not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun ''lu'' (it can mean "he", "she", or "it", depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (''il''), feminine (''el''), and neuter (''ol'') third-person pronouns.{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"|+ Pronouns!rowspan="3"|!colspan="7"|singular! colspan="7" |plural! rowspan="3" |utrum;
