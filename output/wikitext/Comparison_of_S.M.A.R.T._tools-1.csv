Name;Operating system;License;User interface;Fixed drives;USB, eSATA andremovable drives;RAID supportname=RAIDDisks that are members of a RAID array may in some cases have their SMART attributes (data) largely inaccessible to the operating system, or to monitoring tools and software. This depends case-by-case on the RAID controller, operating system, and tools. As of 2012 inroads have been made into this, as RAID becomes wider used, but is still far from assured and not supported by all controllers, systems, or tools.date=September 2012;Shows S.M.A.R.T. attributes;Hard driveself-testing;Notification;Notes
